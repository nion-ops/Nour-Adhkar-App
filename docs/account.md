# Optional account (login / register)

- Sign-in is optional. It is the last onboarding step (page 5); «بعداً، شروع کنیم» skips it and finishes onboarding. Signing in there also finishes onboarding.
- Users can sign in later from the Telegram-style profile header at the top of the drawer (avatar, name, email, streak; «ورود / ثبت‌نام» when signed out). Tapping it opens Profile.
- Email login/register call `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/register` on `https://api.adhkar.ir`.
- The JWT and basic profile are stored in the `account` shared preferences (`AccountRepository`). All app content stays offline and works without an account.

## Profile screen

The email login/register card (or, when signed in, the account-details card with logout), then the achievements banner last. There is no separate identity card; the drawer header shows the avatar.

## Email verification (5-digit code via Resend)

All app requests send `X-Nour-Client: android`. For these requests the API does not issue a token to an unverified email:

1. Register, or log in to an account whose email is not verified yet: the API emails a 5-digit code (branded «اذکار نور» template, sent through Resend) and returns `verification_required: true` (201 on register, 403 on login) with `retry_after`.
2. The app shows five code boxes (paste works; the 5th digit submits automatically). `POST /api/auth/verify-email` with `email`, `password`, `code` returns the token.
3. «ارسال دوباره کد» calls `POST /api/auth/resend-code` (60 s cooldown, shown as a countdown). «تغییر ایمیل» goes back to the form.

Codes expire after 10 minutes, are stored hashed, and lock after 5 wrong attempts (request a new code). The password is required with the code, so a guessed code alone never grants access. Already-verified accounts cannot be signed in through the verify endpoint. The website does not send the header, so web sign-in is unchanged.

## Google sign-in

The login card has a standard "Sign in with Google" button (unmodified four-colour G, white/dark neutral surface, 1dp outline, pill shape). It uses Credential Manager (`GetSignInWithGoogleOption`) to get an ID token and posts it to `POST /api/auth/google`; the API verifies it with Google (`aud` must be in `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS`) and signs in or creates the user as already email-verified, so no code step is needed. Closing Google's chooser shows nothing; no Google account on the device, network, or server problems show friendly Persian messages.

### One-time setup (required for the button to work)

1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials (configure the OAuth consent screen first).
2. Create an OAuth client of type **Web application**. Copy its client id.
3. Create an OAuth client of type **Android**: package `ir.adhkar.app`, SHA-1 of the release signing certificate `A0:2B:BE:E0:EE:1E:EB:A7:7E:3E:6F:07:85:1E:8C:DD:13:D6:02:DB`. (For debug builds add another Android client for `ir.adhkar.app.debug` with the debug keystore SHA-1.) If the app is distributed through a store that re-signs it, also add that store's signing SHA-1.
4. App: add `googleWebClientId=<web client id>` to `local.properties` (or set `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`) and rebuild. Without it the button explains that Google sign-in is not enabled yet.
5. Backend `.env`: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS=<web client id>`, then deploy. Without it the API answers 503 and the app shows a friendly message.
